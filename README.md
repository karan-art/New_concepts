# New_concepts (Statistics and Time series)
Here what new things i learned , i start updating 

New Libraries
- statsmodel
- scipy.stats

Some Basic Concepts:
1. Types of variable
2. Gauissian Distribution
3. Central Tendency
4. Types of Sampling
5. Types of Series
6. Hypothesis testing
- Null and Alternate Hypothesis
- Type 1 & 2 Error
- Level of signifnance and Confidence Level
- P-Value
8. Outlier Detection Techinque
